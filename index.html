                <p>Hi sayang, if you're reading this, it means that the words that you've said a year ago truly has happened. YES, WE MADE IT BABY!!!
                    And I am more than proud and happy to be here today with you by my side. It has been, kind of a ride that was filled with all sorts of feelings and emotions. We've been 
                    through so much together, all the good and bad times had its meaning and it has gotten us to where we are today. And you Arissa Hadirah, you are the reason behind my 
                    happiest moments. I tried so hard to write this properly, so bear with me if it gets a bit messy, you know how I am. So here's a little bit of something for us to look back on the love that we shared, the memories we created and the dreams we'll chase together. 
                    Here's to us, forever and always.

                        Ever since the day I met you, I never thought that you were the one for me. But slowly as time passed, after we got to know each other a little bit more, I thought 
                        to myself that maybe you were that someone that I have been waitng for. You are the most amazing girl that i have ever met in my life. So full of surpirses and you bring
                        that type of energy that somehow, always lightens my day up. You're always full of energy(in a good way) that sometimes even I can't keep up. But, I think that is what makes
                        you so special. You may not be the first girl that I have met in my life, but I want you to know that you really are the first to make me feel seen. First to make me feel comfortable enough to be myself.
                        First to always be there no matter how bad things get. First to understand or at least try to understand my complicated thoughts. And most importantly, the first one 
                        that makes me want to love you truly and wholeheartedly. There is not a day that goes by where I don't have you in my mind. You, Arissa Hadirah, have a special spot in my
                        heart, always.

                    <div class="note-text">
                        I cant begin to describe how much of a difference you had made to my life ever since you've been in it. You always have a way of bringing joy and happiness into my life. There's
                        just something about you that makes me feel at peace even on my darkest days. Your smile, your laughter, your kindness and the way you care not only for me, but for us, is what I 
                        love the most. Because of that, it makes me feel like doing more. Not only trying to be better for myself, but also try to improve for what we have. I know my feelings and thoughts
                        can get a bit messy at times(i promise im working on it), I will always try to be a better man for you and for us. Thank you for bearing with me up until today and for accepting me 
                        for who I am. Sometimes I think to myself, having you just makes everything feel brighter and more meaningful. You're not just a part of my life anymore--you're the best part,
                        and I can't imagine a world without you in it.

                         It is crazy how our love story really started back then during your Dzone dance competition. Not us awkwardly changing
                         from saying "aku","kau" and bantering each other daily to saying "I","you" and being so 'sopan' to each other. Gets me smiling everytime I think about it.
                         Watching you chase your dreams, do what you do best and what you love, has always been my favourite thing to do. You know why? Whenever you're out there doing all those things,
                         there is just this spark in your eyes that makes you, uniquely you. Watching you from the sidelines as you achieve your goals, from small competitions and competing
                         against mak cik's, to winning nationals. And soon, maybe even represent the country. That's my girl. I can never be more proud of you sayang. It's not just about these 
                         dancing competition. All the small wins matters too. Even killing that roach in your room, yes, I am proud of that too!! You are the most amazing girl out there and I want you
                         to know that I will always support you in everything that you do. I will always be proud of you and the person that you have become.

                         Hmm where do I even start. So much has happened throughout the past year and it makes me think about the times that you were not there for me. That's the thing, you were never
                         not there for me. Thank you for being my constant no matter what life throws at us. Your pressence, support, understanding and love means so much to me that I can't even find 
                         the words to express it. You've been there even through my smallest wins and losses. You were always there to listen to my problems and lend your shoulder. Whether it's celebrating 
                         my accomplishments or comforting me during hard times, you've always been by my side. And that is something that I would never be able to replace. You make me feel so safe and comfortable 
                         around. You really are the best thing that has ever happened to me and I am more than lucky to have you here with me.

                        My Arissa Hadirah. If only you had known how beautiful you are. Those small eyes that always seem to light up whenever I look into them, that small nose that 
                        tends to smell literally everything, those round cheeks of yours, and that jawline?? Ooffff sharp af. But those aren't the only things that I want to talk about,
                        you really do have a beautiful soul within you and I am more than glad to have met someone like you. The energy that you bring into my life is irreplaceable. The way 
                        you care and love just makes want to fall in love with you every single time. That smile of yours. I'd do anything just to see you smile because it's the most beautiful
                        thing that I have ever seen. You give me a feeling of comfort whenever I am around you. It's as if everything else in world just goes quiet when I am with you. I want you to
                        know that, whatever happens, don't ever change yourself. You are perfect the way you are and I love every single part of you. Please don't dwell on the past too, beacause without
                        them, you wouldn’t be who you are today.

                        This picture means so much to me. It's just something about it that shows how we really are when we're each other. Comfortable. When I am with you, I never had the feeling
                        where you would judge me for being myself. I can always be who I am when I am with you and that means a lot to me. You sayang, you are my safe space. The times we spent with 
                        each other, without a care in the world speaks a lot. All the goofy things we've done, the stupid jokes we laughed at together(bread ftw), new things we explored and experienced, admiring 
                        each other's pressence and most importantly spending time with one another. If I had the chance to experince every bit of it again, it would most definitely be with you.
                        This picture, made me realised that I don't need anyone else to make me feel full and content, all I need 
                        is this girl right here with an attitude that makes me feel like the luckiest man in the world. I love you sayangg!

                        We have been through so many things together. And I definitely enjoyed every bit of it. There were times we would judge everyone in the room just to have a little laugh together.
                        Times where we would mess around with other people. Sometimes, even gossiping and hearing your gossips is one of the things that I love when I am with you.
                         One day I wake up and have no idea who this person is. 5 mins later I have a beef with this person who I have never met. And the same goes to you, you'd always be there to listen
                         and join me in whatever crisis that I am facing. Knowing that I always have you by my side is overwhelming(in a good way). Because I know, no matter what kind of shit that is about to happen,
                         I will always have my girl with me to go through it together. I want you to know that you can always rely on me no matter what. Nothing will ever get in between me and my girl.

                        I hope you know that I really do appreciate every small thing that you do not only for me, but for us. Sometimes I think that I don't thank you enough for the things that you've done.
                        You took care of me when I was sick. You have put aside all your things just to go buy me food when I was injured. You never lashed out at me whenever I did something that made you angry, 
                        you know how dumb I can be at times. I appreciate every single bit of it. You've done so much just to keep our relationship alive, and I can tell you that you've definitely succeeded in that. 
                        You are so understanding and reasonable that sometimes it scares me. I love you so much for that. I promise you that I will do everything I can to take care of you and give you the world.
                        You mean so much to me and I will never let anything ruin this for us. Thank you, for being the best girlfriend that I could ever ask for sayang.

                        We never know what holds for us in the future. I just want you to remember that, I will always be here no matter what life throws at you. It's okay to be sad sometimes. 
                        You know why? Because I will be here every step of the way. I will be here to pull you out of you darkest moments and push you back up. My arms are always open for you. I'll
                        be here to lend you my shoulder and help you go through whatever you are dealing with. I am here with you, always. Okay sayang? Don't beat yourself up too much if things don't go 
                        your way. We will find a way to sort it out together, like we always do. Even if we get into a fight, I'll be here for you. I don't want you to go away and deal with those feelings 
                        on your own. Take some time and whenever you're ready, I'll be here to listen to you and understand you. Keep that smile on your face okayy. It looks cute on you.

                        Where do I start? There is just so much to talk about you. Whenever I look at you, I just have this feeling of calmness that overwhelms me. Yes, you may get a little bit 
                        energetic and chaotic at times, but those are also the things that I love about you. You sayang, have so much potential in you and I hope you realise that. Sometimes it just 
                        amazes me how hard you work for the things that you want in life. And whenever you face setbacks, I know it can make you feel down and sad, but I dont worry, because I know
                        that somehow, you always find your way out of it. You're smart. Independent. You never let anything get in your way. I've always admired that about you. To me, you're so much 
                        more than my girlfriend. You're my best friend, my supporter who never leaves my side, you are different from everyone else, special, sometimes acts like my mom, and hopefully one day, ]
                        my future wife. Promise me we'll try our best to keep this together?

                        Women in the world and you're the only one that I have my eyes on. There may be so many other women in the world, but they don't have my attention like you do. It doesn't
                        matter what they look like, who they are, where they come from, how rich they are. You know why? It's because I know that they will never be able to make me feel loved and content 
                        the way you do. I don't need anyone else in the world when I have you with me. Everytime I look into your eyes, I see them glow. Everytime I hear your voice, I feel as calm as I can be.
                        Everytime I feel your touch, I feel so warm. Your smile. Your personality. You. Everytime I am with you, I feel... complete. And that is something that I will forever cherish in my life.

                I wanted to take a moment and express my truest feelings to you and to let you know just how much you mean to me. These
                lines in here are not just words on your screen. It's a piece
                of what I have in my heart. I just want to say that, I am blessed to have you in my life. From the day you walked in,
                you gave it meaning and made it so beautiful. I'd also like to
                say that, I am sorry if I have ever hurt your feelings in any way whether it was on purpose or me being silly. Thank
                you, for always putting up with me, for always giving me your endless
                support, for calling me out when I do things that I am not supposed to, for making me so happy, for accepting me for who
                I am, and... for being the love of my life. Although we still have
                such a long way to go, but over the time, you have become more than just someone that I love. I want to go through all
                of what life has to offer with you and share these small moments together
                as we grow older. You are the person that I want to spend the rest of my life with, forever.
